This program controls a vintage radio based on RaspberryPi, Pi MusicBox (http://www.pimusicbox.com/), a Nokia 5110 LCD display, two rotary encoders and a DIY amp based on the IC TDA2002A.

Presently, one encoder is used to go to next station and the other encoder is user to go to the previous station. It is implemented that way because of the low quality of the encoders, on the future I pretend to use just one encoder for this (clockwise: next station, counterclockwise: previous station).
